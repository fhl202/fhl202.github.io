  <p>Under quite globally uniform forcing, surface temperature
responses behave like local responses to the global mean radiative
forcing, even away from equilibrium. In models, this means that
simulated patterns of temperature change look similar under different
forcing scenarios. In the real world, it means that land and ocean
temperatures continue to increase in a constant ratio that we do not
expect to change if warming accelerates or if it slows down. This is
true even though the land shows a much smaller heat capacity to
climate change than the ocean.</p>
<p>The constant ratio and similar patterns occur because the
atmosphere is very good at transporting heat, particularly around a
latitude circle. This makes detecting the influence of poorly
understood regional aerosol forcings difficult, because their
influence is not strongly regionally confined. Regional forcings do
have slightly different temperature signatures, however, even
large-scale sulphate aerosol forcing, as
<strong>Manoj Joshi</strong> convinced me.</p>
<p>This means that one can detect regional forcings (old news, I
know), although surface temperature response might not be the best way
to go about it. In fact, it might be the atmospheric energy transport
that we should be trying to trace, perhaps through its impact on the
hydrological cycle. This is part of the reason <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe
Osborne<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looked at aerosol impacts on European rainfall.</p>
<p>The flipside of all this, is that solar radiation management
geoengineering&lt; schemes that rely on regional forcing
or forcing that doesn&rsquo;t have the same spatial signature as
CO<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> forcing will work. Because they
will stimulate changes in atmospheric energy transport, however, they
might stimulate nasty or at least unpredictable changes in the
hydrological cycle.</p>
