  <h1>Radiative forcing and response</h1>
  <time datetime=2025-04-08T22:06:31&#43;0100 class="post-date">Tue, Apr 8, 2025</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve done a fair bit of research on radiative forcing and feedbacks, especially short-term adjustment to
forcing, but mostly not for a long time. I answered a challenge from <strong>Patrick Taylor</strong> at
NASA Langley to explain the pattern of the regional tropical water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks.
These don&rsquo;t show a sharp anti-correlation like the tropical mean water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks
across climate models, but they are largely explained by simple processes. Regional variations in the tropical lapse
rate feedback in particular are determined by the difference in the varying tropical surface temperature
and the fairly constant atmospheric temperature. This work was published as Lambert and Taylor, (2014).</p>
<p><strong>Angus Ferraro</strong> published a follow up, Ferraro et al., (2015), tested these ideas using satellite observations. It was found that the ideas
are largely supported, providing a &ldquo;useful process-based test of climate models&rdquo; even if the results are unconnected
to determining the more important mean tropical lapse rate and water vapour feedbacks.</p>
<p>My earliest paper on forcing and response was Lambert and Faull, (2007), which described the basic differences in global
mean response between carbon dioxide and solar forced climate model experiments: tropospheric adjustments deal with
forcing absorbed by the atmosphere by reducing precipitation in the carbon dioxide case and increasing outgoing
longwave in the solar case. It took four years to get it published, the results were mostly written-up by others
before I got it out there and the results that weren&rsquo;t published by others were better reproduced elsewhere
afterwards. (Also the altitude hypothesis for tropospheric adjustment in the final paragraph is almost certainly
wrong.) But&hellip; it was the first piece of work I ever did on my own. Having the idea, testing it and
realising that it was right convinced me to become a professional scientist. Whether this is good for
me or anyone else remains unclear.</p>
