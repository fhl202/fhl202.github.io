### I currently work with the following people:


[**Alex Loader**](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/35300-alex-loader/about) is a PhD student
  working on how interactions between physics and chemistry influence
  the fate of condensibles on exoplanets. He is supervised by me and [Eric Hebrard](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/eh484). 

[**Danny McCulloch**](https://physics-astronomy.exeter.ac.uk/staff/dm575) is a PhD student
  working on the local and remote effects of the interactions between
  cloud and circulation, associated with the NERC CIRCULATES
  project. He is supervised by me, Mark Webb at the Met Office and [Geoff Vallis](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/).

[**Monisha Natchiar**](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/35547-monisha-natchiar-subbiah-renganathan/about) is a
  research fellow working on understanding cloud
  feedbacks as part of the NERC CIRCULATES project with [Geoff Vallis](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/)
  and me.

[**Kasturi Singh**](http://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/staff/ks1034) is a Leverhulme funded
	     research fellow 
	     working on understanding parametric and structural
	     uncertainty in NWP modelling in collaboration
	     with [Hannah
