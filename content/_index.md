I am an associate professor (equivalent of UK reader) in the 
[Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/research/fluid-dynamics/)
      group, 
      which is part of the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk)
      at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk). I am a
        member of the [Exeter Exoplanet Theory Group](https://exoclimatology.com/).


At present, my main research interests are:

- Large scale atmospheric physics and climatology of the Earth and other planets
- Clouds and the hydrological cycle
- Understanding model parameterisations

To find out more about what we do, please visit the [Research](../research) and [Group](../group) pages.


I joined Exeter in 2010, after a PhD  in the [Climate Dynamics
      Group](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/climate-dynamics) in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at Oxford, a
      brief stint at [CEH Wallingford]("http://www.ceh.ac.uk/)
      two years at the [University
      of California, Berkeley](http://www.atmos.berkeley.edu/) and three years at
        the [UK Met Office Hadley Centre](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/science-behind-climate-change/hadley)
