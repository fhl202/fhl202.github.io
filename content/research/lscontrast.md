Under quite globally uniform forcing, surface temperature
	responses behave like local responses to the global mean radiative
	forcing, even away from equilibrium. In models, this means that 
	simulated patterns of temperature change look similar under different
	forcing scenarios. In the real world, it means that land and ocean
	temperatures continue to increase in a constant ratio that we do not
	expect to change if warming accelerates or if it slows down. This is
	true even though the land shows a much smaller heat capacity to
	climate change than the ocean.

The constant ratio and similar patterns occur because the
	atmosphere is very good at transporting heat, particularly around a
	latitude circle. This makes detecting the influence of poorly
	understood regional aerosol forcings difficult, because their
	influence is not strongly regionally confined. Regional forcings do
	have slightly different temperature signatures, however, even
	large-scale sulphate aerosol forcing, as
	**Manoj Joshi** convinced me.

This means that one can detect regional forcings (old news, I
	know), although surface temperature response might not be the best way
	to go about it. In fact, it might be the atmospheric energy transport 
	that we should be trying to trace, perhaps through its impact on the
	hydrological cycle. This is part of the reason <a href="group.html">Joe
	Osborne</a> looked at aerosol impacts on European rainfall.
	
The flipside of all this, is that solar radiation management
	geoengineering< schemes that rely on regional forcing
	or forcing that doesn't have the same spatial signature as
	CO<sub>2</sub> forcing will work. Because they
	will stimulate changes in atmospheric energy transport, however, they
	might stimulate nasty or at least unpredictable changes in the
	hydrological cycle.
